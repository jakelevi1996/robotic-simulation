# robotic-simulation

This repository is primarily for coursework submission to 4M20: 'Robotics' coursework 1.

## File description

Coming soon

## TODO

- Include equation of motion to model *dynamic* torques (instead of static approximation): might be helpful to use numerically differentiated traces
- Calculating and storing both x0 and x1 and both x3 and x4 uses unnecessary time and space (although it is convenient)
- Animate trajectory
