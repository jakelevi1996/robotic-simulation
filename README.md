# robotic-simulation

This repository is primarily for coursework submission to 4M20: 'Robotics' coursework 1.

## TODO

- Add speeds (use numerical differentiation ?? Quantify dependence on dt ??)
- Include equation of motion to model torques: if using exclusively joint positions, velocities, and accelerations, then don't need to use any angles, and don't need to assume that one foot is stuck to the floor ?????
- Plot multiple traces on the same axes
